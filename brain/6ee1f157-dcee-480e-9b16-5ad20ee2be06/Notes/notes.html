<p>On Thursday evening, just hours after Trump tapped him for the job, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://wJq9WbVTPE-OAfA5xDSH5g/JohnBolton">John Bolton</a> held a call with longtime advisors, including <a class="thought-link" href="brain://V_Hhbu7cDkibFlrSDuK-Bg/MatthewFreedman">Matthew Freedman</a>, a Republican consultant who once advised Bolton at the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://apBZBOU3DUCQLTyGSjlDTQ/DepartmentOfState">Department of State</a> and the United Nations. Freedman is currently helping manage the transition, according to a source familiar with the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freedman is a very political guy that Bolton likes,&rdquo; one Republican source said. &ldquo;He is overly ambitious about cleaning house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freedman disputed that account, saying he was not aware of the Thursday phone call. &ldquo;I can tell you there is no list,&rdquo; he said.</p>
