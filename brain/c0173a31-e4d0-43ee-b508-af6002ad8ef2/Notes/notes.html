<p>In light of the raids on Cohen's office, home, and hotel, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://gD21dhWCLkKW0uaV8-cLrw/KenWhite">Ken White</a>&nbsp;(Popehat) observes:</p>
<p>It's early times. Watch for the search warrant itself&mdash;that will show us what crimes they are investigating and what documents they think are probative of that crime. Watch also for what Michael Cohen's lawyers do in the struggle to compel arbitration with Stormy Daniels in a federal court in Los Angeles&mdash;the search warrant dramatically complicates whether Cohen can, or should, submit to any questions in that case. Be skeptical of the surge of misinformation and inaccurate legal takes that are certain to drop. But watch. This is historic.</p>
