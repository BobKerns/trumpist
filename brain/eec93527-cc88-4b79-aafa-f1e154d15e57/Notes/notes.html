<p>Ms. McFarland reportedly wrote in a <a class="thought-link" href="brain://N2nydROvikizYbsKUCz8BA/20161229">2016-12-29</a> email [<a class="thought-link" href="brain://JzXJ7ojMeUuq-vHhVNFeVw/McFarlandEmail">McFarland Email</a>] that sanctions announced hours earlier by the Obama administration were aimed at discrediting Trump&rsquo;s victory.
