<h2>Politico Report</h2>
<p>Two weeks after her return from <a class="thought-link" href="brain://NjHfD9TdGkeBplv1x37t4g/Vienna">Vienna</a>, in remarks at <a class="thought-link" href="brain://bc74KGNPAEav57CQlXyRvw/Aei">AEI</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://KQhyHrs9jEiHmwnIF1BCvg/NikkiHaley">Nikki Haley</a> floated what one NSC official described as the &ldquo;initial trial balloon&rdquo; for the path the administration laid out on Friday. &ldquo;The purpose of the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://bc74KGNPAEav57CQlXyRvw/Aei">AEI</a> speech was to figure out, &lsquo;Is this gonna work? Does this thread that needle?&rsquo;&rdquo; the official said, describing a strategy by which the president would decertify the deal but remain a party to it.</p>
<p>In that speech, Haley differentiated between the nuclear agreement itself and the legally mandated congressional certification. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very important distinction to keep in mind, because many people confuse the requirements of the deal with the requirements of U.S. law,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, the Iran deal has so many flaws that it&rsquo;s tempting to leave it. But, the deal was constructed in a way that makes leaving it less attractive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It gave <a class="thought-link" href="brain://kQ2ftr-yykWf-ywrkAWPQA/Iran">Iran</a> what it wanted upfront, in exchange for temporary promises to deliver what we want.&rdquo;</p>
