<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="257" data-total-count="2968">Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm&rsquo;s commercial division &ldquo;discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.&rdquo; The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="3180">Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.</p>
<p class="headline">&ldquo;We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,&rdquo; he wrote in response to a question from The Times. &ldquo;Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="story-continues-4" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="3634">But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company&rsquo;s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="99" data-total-count="3733">&ldquo;I remember being super confused,&rdquo; said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="3928">&ldquo;I kept asking Alexander, &lsquo;Can you explain to me what they want?&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, referring to Mr. Nix. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="4172">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sending them stuff about political targeting &mdash; they then come and ask more about political targeting,&rdquo; Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil &ldquo;just didn&rsquo;t seem to be interested&rdquo; in how the techniques could be used commercially.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="317" data-total-count="4489">Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="158" data-total-count="4647">A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie&rsquo;s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="4973">Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56780">has met</a> with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-kremlin-pr/exclusive-kremlin-tells-companies-to-deliver-good-news-idUSKBN1DE0MP">received instructions</a> from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="5152">Mr. Nix, for his part, has long been adamant. &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t have business in Russia,&rdquo; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/06/the-ceo-of-cambridge-analytica-plans-a-book-on-its-methods-and-the-us-election/">he told TechCrunch</a> last year. &ldquo;We have no involvement in Russia, never have done.&rdquo;</p>
