<h2>FBI requested as House witnessTo ensure a full accounting of the FBI&rsquo;s investigative work identifying and countering Russia&rsquo;s election interference in 2016, and developments since, to include President Trump&rsquo;s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, it is imperative that the Committee interview key senior FBI officials. Among others, the Committee should interview former FBI Director Comey, who the Committee has not heard from since his termination; former General Counsel James Baker, who can address FBI&rsquo;s internal deliberations and decision-making throughout 2016 and post-election; and FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who was involved in the Bureau&rsquo;s counterintelligence investigation at key junctures.</h2>
