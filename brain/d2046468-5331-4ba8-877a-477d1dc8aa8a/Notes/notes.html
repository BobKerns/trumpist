<p>Cohen has been a long-time aide to Trump, but he found himself facing the national media glare last month when he defended his boss to a <a class="thought-link" href="brain://pvLa9bjLwECfBvC75g2ENA/DailyBeast">Daily Beast</a> reporter in a story about rebuffed allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump.<br />Cohen has since publicly apologized for telling the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://pvLa9bjLwECfBvC75g2ENA/DailyBeast">Daily Beast</a> that "you cannot rape your spouse" and has repeatedly said that he does not believe that statement. "As an attorney, husband and father there are many injustices that offend me but nothing more than charges of rape or racism. They hit me at my core," Cohen said in an apology statement to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://D2sNm-VNnk-iYA_bGNdnzQ/Cnn">CNN</a>.<br /> <br /> Cohen has served as a media liaison to Trump, helping to coordinate interviews.
