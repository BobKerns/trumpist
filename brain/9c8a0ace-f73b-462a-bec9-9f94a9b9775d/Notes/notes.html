<h2>Quote</h2>
<p>Keeping the firm&rsquo;s client list fresh in mind also helps consultants avoid relationship-based conflicts, said Cleta Mitchell, a campaign finance attorney at Foley &amp; Lardner, LLP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People get used to dealing with the same pollster, media buyer, tech person &mdash; you really do have to stop and think,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;These are complicated rules and you have to work to figure out what kind of business you want to do and who wants to hire you to do what, and how you create the necessary structures to be compliant with the law.&rdquo;</p>
