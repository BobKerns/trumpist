<p>Natalia Veselnitskaya: Ms. Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials on&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://2jNVrlmHl0OUSBWizVyCDA/20160609">June 9, 2016</a>, ostensibly to provide the campaign &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; on its opponent, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://8_wR0Uqxv0GN_fQlfGtDhw/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, has expressed willingness publicly to speak to congressional investigators and reportedly has responded in writing to questions from the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://DMdB8cLoMEaqep9ey5stLg/SenateJudiciaryCommittee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>. However, she has never been invited to appear before the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://VTE0BbKC_0-JZ3N15bCuOg/HouseIntelligenceCommittee">House Intelligence Committee</a>. The Committee therefore should engage Ms. Veselnitskaya to determine her willingness to provide testimony about key events of interest.</p>
