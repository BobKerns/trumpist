<h1>By Thread</h1>
<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://dwJ03Kreik-jzsygbnT5Bg/ByThread">By Thread</a> is intended to allow you to trace through complex series of related events.</p>
<p>It is still in the early stages, as I focus on filling in the needed events.</p>
<p>Threads all use the same heavy orangish link type, and are labelled with one or more thread labels.</p>
<p>Thread labels allow you to see what thread the connection is part of.</p>
<p>A Thread link implies a Time link since you cannot have two links between the same two nodes.</p>
<p>For the same reason, a Thread link may be labelled with more than one thread label.</p>
