<p>Based on public reporting that the Russian disinformation campaign reached several social media platforms beyond <a class="thought-link" href="brain://kxLKVBDoLkKJw_eDwkhZ5g/Twitter">Twitter</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://zJ3g-7t_CkGtc1kYHRyxgw/Facebook">Facebook</a>, and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://HKW04NCnb02RrkLKjGWkkQ/YouTube">YouTube</a>, we recommend sending document request letters to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://0spVY3w34Eilg_L-F2qxSw/Snapchat">Snapchat</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Aac5X-uldEGkk5SrsRVNJg/Imgur">Imgur</a> asking them to study the scope and scale of the Russian campaign on their platforms. The <a class="thought-link" href="brain://-ZNV-350v0aUtM0Y1gRdeQ/Minority">Minority</a> sent a document request on <a class="thought-link" href="brain://5v28-Ljje0u4Cs32kVo_vA/20180307">2018-03-07</a> to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://iMQ1ktr_C0CP_kpGv7Gleg/Reddit">Reddit</a> and Tumblr, which the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://efaGMgwG5kmdu114BabPmA/Majority">Majority</a> declined to join. We would further suggest that these companies coordinate with Twitter and Facebook in particular to share common markers and indicators of Russian activity. We would also recommend requesting a briefing from each of 15 these companies alongside receipt of internal data and research relevant to the Committee&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
