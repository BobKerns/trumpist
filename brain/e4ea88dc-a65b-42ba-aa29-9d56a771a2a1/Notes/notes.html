<p>Lots and of stuff happening this week. I've been too sick to catch up, but the most dramatic has to be the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://JQ2LQ_G2LEiMz64tef6gqA/CohenVUs">Cohen v US</a> hearing where <a class="thought-link" href="brain://auLZC9Le7E-ToRSqqhvZwQ/SeanHannity">Sean Hannity</a> was outed.</p>
<p>As legal cases and lawyers are playing an ever larger role, I'm filling in some of that background. One striking feature is "<a class="thought-link" href="brain://BAamYN_hm0OWPKUAAk7QXg/LawyersInTooManyPlaces">Lawyers in Too Many Places</a>".&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a class="thought-link" href="brain://BNDTICJb2UaZ8J-TVfYMYA/20180409">2018-04-09</a> 22:10 Lawyers Behaving Badly</h2>
<p>So much happening.&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://aCeqfRRq7UyU7HnPJrQ6sw/FbiRaidsCohensOfficeHomeHotel">FBI Raids Cohen's Office, Home, Hotel</a>, which made the various sex lawsuits suddenly more relevant, so I expanded the&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://INwNvmHGoUWEhzYIvzaGKw/McDougalCase">McDougal Case</a>,&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yp-ziCyoVUm0eoHiDMJi_Q/StormyDanielsCase">Stormy Daniels Case</a>, and related cases and events.</p>
<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://aGQE0jFTqEuHekd9Hciqig/MichaelCohen">Michael Cohen</a>'s involvement on the&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://L4qqdvMZM0qh8sURStJP0Q/RncFinanceCommittee">RNC Finance Committee</a> lead to expanding that. And, of course, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://dymfqOJM4UqHU6Nhrx6Wjg/SteveWynn">Steve Wynn</a>, who has his own sex scandal lawsuits, as well as his own history with Trump.</p>
<p>Then late in the day came the news that Manafort has filed to suppress the evidence in his home, so I'll want to grab that when I get a chance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, there's also Syria, Trump's outbursts in the War Room, as well as a myriad lesser matters I didn't capture today.</p>
<p>May Trump take tomorrow for reflection upon his many sins against the republic and decency, and give me a breather. Because I must also file with the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://P1qy6WfywUaod2VTfV5W5g/Irs">IRS</a>.</p>

<h3>The President's Lawyer: Analysis</h3>
<p>I&nbsp;<em>was</em> working on fleshing out the structure of the Federal Court system. I was adding links for the individual&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://npBcf33JeEOwGj7kKhDJQA/UsAppealsCourts">US Appeals Courts</a> when I took a moment to check on Trump's legal team.</p>
<p>Boy, did that drag me down a rathole of unexpected linkages, with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://AflJseqVU06O-Lmu3hzCAQ/PatRobertson">Pat Robertson</a>'s televangelism via his <a class="thought-link" href="brain://BLsPVH6xO0W7jc9kSd7I7w/ChristianBroadcastingNetwork">Christian Broadcasting Network</a>, his <a class="thought-link" href="brain://YFSrL0NAdUmtOwfNoWsthQ/1999">1999</a>&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://m_d_RzpqaEW4vDtNGbYBDA/Aclj">ACLJ</a> counter to the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://YWQ9i0quSUesX-qKfs6T-A/Aclu">ACLU</a>, now fully in the hands of it's former chief litigator, one <a class="thought-link" href="brain://97FNARL97kWKoc0Azbhx-A/JaySekulow">Jay Sekulow</a> &ndash; and his family-run, family-enriching <a class="thought-link" href="brain://AnN37AqwS0Wrq28LWB8Uxg/ChristianAdvocatesServingEvangelism">Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism</a>. His 990's raised big red flags with me.</p>
<p>But AGs&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://jUwlGy4LtE6Zq7YdY48ewg/EricSchneiderman">Eric Schneiderman</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://RR3jerh030mjUGLXBOP6jA/JoshStein">Josh Stein</a> beat me to it; they have already been investigating.</p>
<p>He may have the ethics of a prosperity gospel televangelist, but he's won some cases at the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://I3uHYh0_kEiBacu0SDBspQ/SupremeCourt">Supreme Court</a>, including his first, the 1987 <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Sa62sllHGEa3n9HTfpKh0Q/BoardOfAirportCommrsOfLosAngelesVJewsForJesusInc">Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.</a>, which brought us free speech zones in airports.</p>
<h3>Lobbyists, Campaign consultants, and spies</h3>
<p>Adding to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://DCPAczT4k0Wp6stnXIltsA/PaulManafort">Paul Manafort</a>'s building legal woes is the discovery (through corporate filings uncovered by&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://pvLa9bjLwECfBvC75g2ENA/DailyBeast">Daily Beast</a> reporter <a class="thought-link" href="brain://LBprzkZl_kyab1ar7zz5IQ/LachlanMarchay">Lachlan Markay</a>) that&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://1TPepQapH0qVXCxhnjonTA/KonstantinKilimnik">Konstantin Kilimnik</a> actually is business partners with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://wMmr6ePCGk2pL-AHJmewQw/SamPatten">Sam Patten</a>, who helped with the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> microtargeting.</p>
<p>Which would bring us back to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://u1yhv9vTVkaEJnFpaDgH2w/RebekahMercer">Rebekah Mercer</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://qZYbGkEMU0OcTp7vy2mV9g/SteveBannon">Steve Bannon</a>, and a whole lot of money on the US side.</p>
<p>The story and linkages are here:&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://rJ2KxiMyeE2kpwI0H48djQ/BegemotVenturesInternational">Begemot Ventures International</a>. And&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://wMmr6ePCGk2pL-AHJmewQw/SamPatten">Sam Patten</a> and&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://1TPepQapH0qVXCxhnjonTA/KonstantinKilimnik">Konstantin Kilimnik</a>. There's a lot to unpack into the model here, but I link a sample of the news stories involved.</p>
<p>If you wonder at all the incomplete threads&mdash;they come so fast, and they're so tangled, and every time I dig for original sources, I find more than I expect.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my mission isn't to dig out the information or capture and preserve it all, but to try to synthesize it into a navigable whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So wherever Trumpist Brain takes you, remember, "There you are!"&mdash;and there's probably a lot more where that came from.</p>
