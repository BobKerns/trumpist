<p>Mr. Nader, an adviser to Emirati crown prince <a class="thought-link" href="brain://qdoFEFu6wUmstF5CO-tFMg/MohammedBinZayedAlNahyan">Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan</a> with ties to the Trump campaign and Administration, likely can provide information to the Committee about reported attempts by Trump associates to set up a secret backchannel with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://TH6x1eCQXka8Fd7izZgb3w/Russia">Russia</a> during the presidential transition period. Mr. Nader reportedly was present in the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://p0k25PRl506YceoJWkW55A/Seychelles">Seychelles</a> in January 2017 when <a class="thought-link" href="brain://YDMP0gT6B0GZGjz50cgrqw/ErikPrince">Erik Prince</a> attended a secret meeting with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://b7SFnqQBBEGqYGT64MiblQ/KirillDmitriev">Kirill Dmitriev</a>, the head of the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://e1KBdWZjwEyg-6VyFuKlSg/RussianDirectInvestmentFund">Russian Direct Investment Fund</a>, and during a <a class="thought-link" href="brain://oLLC0jEatEaVhR9oOQ120w/201612">December 2016</a> meeting with Emirati officials and Trump transition personnel which may have been a precursor to the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://oigpGBtsd0ObNm9OrZX9pg/SeychellesMeeting">Seychelles Meeting</a>.</p>

<p>In consideration of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s ongoing investigative equities, the Committee also has deferred interviewing <a class="thought-link" href="brain://FPnI7WWl3kyNJMDM4Gu8Gw/MichaelFlynn">Michael Flynn</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://DCPAczT4k0Wp6stnXIltsA/PaulManafort">Paul Manafort</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://0xLrOzsYwUmgnFO-bkY5EA/RichardGates">Richard Gates</a>, and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://6ztXAJNFi0mXNyvKLIH6bQ/GeorgePapadopoulos">George Papadopoulos</a>, but these interviews will be essential to a complete understanding of the issues of collusion and obstruction of justice. To conduct a legitimate investigation, the Committee would need to interview these individuals, whether or not they have reached plea agreements or are the subject of criminal indictments. For example, Mr. Flynn specifically informed the Committee via his attorney on June 7, 2017 that he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; the Committee did not demand his appearance, as a result. In light of Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s guilty plea, the Committee should revisit his appearance and seek to negotiate his testimony. The Committee also ought to interview other individuals who may be of investigative interest to the Special Counsel, reportedly such as <a class="thought-link" href="brain://ojQ1i9I1x0ezKhXZw1ZhQw/GeorgeNader">George Nader</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://FM1d_hM-m0Cx9Bx_3kDJ9A/SimonaMangiante">Simona Mangiante</a>.</p>
