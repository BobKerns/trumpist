<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> produced initial documents in response to the Committee&rsquo;s production request and the Committee interviewed CEO <a class="thought-link" href="brain://ZWfXVUNMokeCm2cR5e-LxA/AlexanderNix">Alexander Nix</a> by video-teleconference. This impractical arrangement was decided unilaterally by the Majority, despite Mr. Nix acknowledging during the interview that he travels regularly to the United States and would have been open to an in-person interview. In light of Mr. Nix&rsquo;s testimony, information that has come to light about the company&rsquo;s role in supporting the Trump campaign&rsquo;s digital operation, and his company&rsquo;s effort to acquire Wikileaks&rsquo; database of hacked emails related to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://8_wR0Uqxv0GN_fQlfGtDhw/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, it is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>. This includes key investor <a class="thought-link" href="brain://u1yhv9vTVkaEJnFpaDgH2w/RebekahMercer">Rebekah Mercer</a>; Chief Data Officer <a class="thought-link" href="brain://ynzgMWU4j0C2RDt0GI2IAA/AlexanderTayler">Alexander Tayler</a>; and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://5c0ytGZggE6zGM6BVNObfg/JulianWheatland">Julian Wheatland</a>, Chairman of Cambridge Analytica&rsquo;s parent company <a class="thought-link" href="brain://KuFwY1E3gEaU_k70Gpz1eA/SclGroup">SCL Group</a>. The Committee would also benefit by hearing from individuals responsible for campaign embed teams, and those at Cambridge Analytica headquarters to whom they reported, as well as leadership in the Political Affairs, Digital, and Product offices.</p>
