<p>Attached are two copies of the complaint.</p>
<p>The first one is obtained from the court via Court Listener via RECAP via PACER. It is poorly scanned and not OCRed, but it is a true and accurate copy. The filename has been modified to better identify it in this context.</p>
<p>The second (ENHANCED-US v Prevezon #1 Complaint) is obtained from the Justice Department website. This was chosen as it does not have the document header added by the court, which conflicts with the deskewing operation.</p>
<p>It has then been enhanced with Adobe Acrobat DC, deskewed, despeckled, downsampled to 600 DPI and OCRed as Editable Text, to maximize the usability of the resulting OCR. Editable Text replaces the image text with text in a synthesize font, which makes it much more readable, as well.</p>
<p>Each of these steps renders it no longer a true and accurate copy. The result, however, is closer to what ought to have been filed in the first place&mdash;a competent PDF with text free of artifacts from printing, scanning, and OCR.</p>
<p>The OCR performs particularly poorly on text justified to both right and left margins, especially when done with narrow columns, as the OCR process fails to understand the intent of the inserted spaces. The use of a fixed width font likely exacerbates the problem.</p>
<p>However, the use of Editable Text introduces the risk of changed content in the face of OCR errors. The presented text is as OCRed, not as scanned.</p>
