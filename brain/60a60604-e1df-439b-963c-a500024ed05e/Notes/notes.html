<h1>Lawyers in Too Many Places</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Certain lawyers have a way of cropping up in ways that denote connections other than just running a law practice.</p>
<p>These may not always be nefarious connection, but in some cases, there is the appearance of, or even legal allegation of, something more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But at a minimum, they represent surprising connections that have bearing on understanding this milleu.</p>
<h2><a class="thought-link" href="brain://Vez2V9KuCEqz9DcLB0CSwg/AlanDershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a></h2>
<p>Logically, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Vez2V9KuCEqz9DcLB0CSwg/AlanDershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a> belongs further down this list. But I feel an ethical obligation to point this out here, at the start, because it is far too easy to look at connections, imagine what&nbsp;<em>could</em> be true, and, because it fits the connections, rush to belief and begin constructing a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Even legal allegations are not necessarily correct. I am no fan nor defender of <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Vez2V9KuCEqz9DcLB0CSwg/AlanDershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a>. However, based on examining the allegations, his refutation, and the manner they were brought to bear in <a class="thought-link" href="brain://rFkLd6YgCUyvwTN58QsLxg/DoeCvraPetition">Doe CVRA Petition</a>, I believe the allegations to be false.</p>
<p>If I have a bias on this, it is toward victims, but there have also been high profile cases involving children and claims of sexual abuse which have been manufactured or elicited.</p>
<p>But in addition to his legal advice to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://rSMIW-Zu70uU7oCUnhQYHA/JeffreyEpstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> and his subsequent entangled in the associated CVRA case, Dershowitz shows up in <a class="thought-link" href="brain://7EerB9sVPUy7xHbjkusdKA/BroidyVQatar">Broidy v Qatar</a> and dinners with Trump at the White House. The stated connection is Israel, on which Dershowitz has long been active.</p>
<h2><a class="thought-link" href="brain://aGQE0jFTqEuHekd9Hciqig/MichaelCohen">Michael Cohen</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://aGQE0jFTqEuHekd9Hciqig/MichaelCohen">Michael Cohen</a> needs no real introduction. He has long represented <a class="thought-link" href="brain://uiDkXV044ESy18iajFuM3A/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> and the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://ciIU66mNb0SLDcC7Jvv4Ag/TrumpOrganization">Trump Organization</a>, and the dramatic hearing in his <a class="thought-link" href="brain://JQ2LQ_G2LEiMz64tef6gqA/CohenVUs">Cohen v US</a> case that lead to revealing <a class="thought-link" href="brain://auLZC9Le7E-ToRSqqhvZwQ/SeanHannity">Sean Hannity</a> as one of his clients is one that will be vividly remembered for decades.</p>
<p>I should, perhaps, point out that it is really Hannity as client of the President's lawyer(s) which is the out-of-place piece, and Hannity's non-disclosure of this will likely cost him his job, in my estimation. Hannity's on-air defenses, having Cohen on as guest, then joking about hiring him as lawyer, and the connections between Trump's tweets and Hannity's show, make even the most innocuous interpretation of the connection, a matter of at least journalistic concern.</p>
<p>But Cohen was firmly on this list even prior to that moment.</p>
<p>His NDAs and involvement with the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yp-ziCyoVUm0eoHiDMJi_Q/StormyDanielsCase">Stormy Daniels Case</a> and the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://INwNvmHGoUWEhzYIvzaGKw/McDougalCase">McDougal Case</a> put him there, but also his role as Deputy Chair of the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://L4qqdvMZM0qh8sURStJP0Q/RncFinanceCommittee">RNC Finance Committee</a>, which put him in with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://N1B5ZAfYH0yO26IS3_oiyg/ElliottBroidy">Elliott Broidy</a> on the same committee. Broidy has his own sex scandal, and there is Cohen and (again) Davidson with a convenient NDA and an LLC through which to launder the payments.</p>
<p>And, in what surely has to be coincidence, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://7EerB9sVPUy7xHbjkusdKA/BroidyVQatar">Broidy v Qatar</a> brings in reference to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Vez2V9KuCEqz9DcLB0CSwg/AlanDershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a>. This is just dramatic overkill!</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://1uSKMt7fBkmGHqNGi8nENQ/KiethDavidson">Kieth Davidson</a></h2>
<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://1uSKMt7fBkmGHqNGi8nENQ/KiethDavidson">Kieth Davidson</a> crops up here as the lawyer for the other side in the sex NDA cases. By itself, that would not put him on this list, even if it were due to some equivalent of "ambulance chasing".&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, his opposite in these cases is <a class="thought-link" href="brain://aGQE0jFTqEuHekd9Hciqig/MichaelCohen">Michael Cohen</a>, and the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://INwNvmHGoUWEhzYIvzaGKw/McDougalCase">McDougal Case</a> explicitly alleges collusion between them, earning him a spot.</p>
<p>On <a class="thought-link" href="brain://HAs0qnJVX0am2uwylVjmnA/20180422">2018-04-22</a> it was revealed that he is cooperating with federal investigators.</p>

<h2><a class="thought-link" href="brain://97FNARL97kWKoc0Azbhx-A/JaySekulow">Jay Sekulow</a></h2>
<p>That&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://97FNARL97kWKoc0Azbhx-A/JaySekulow">Jay Sekulow</a> should show up as Trump's lawyer for the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://oucd6aT6c06jcVU4VcBBxQ/MuellerInvestigation">Mueller Investigation</a> is on the surface surprising, as his specialty has been so-called "religious freedom" cases as head of the ALCJ, created by <a class="thought-link" href="brain://AflJseqVU06O-Lmu3hzCAQ/PatRobertson">Pat Robertson</a> but now controlled by Sekulow. Sekulow has his own legal issues around his foundation's funds. (See <a class="thought-link" href="brain://4RVpjepakkqW3VZ9G1rCKA/AcljCaseNy">ACLJ Case NY</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://qep058fuSk-HLku_k0EP0w/AcljCaseNc">ACLJ Case NC</a> for details).</p>
<p>What earns him a spot on this list, however is, again, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://auLZC9Le7E-ToRSqqhvZwQ/SeanHannity">Sean Hannity</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a class="thought-link" href="brain://pAN8rjhK1UyYQbxu--dQig/VictoriaToensing">Victoria Toensing</a> and&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://Qk_IqTrA9U-OqKjaoFa6RA/JoeDiGenovia">Joe diGenovia</a></h2>
<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://pAN8rjhK1UyYQbxu--dQig/VictoriaToensing">Victoria Toensing</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Qk_IqTrA9U-OqKjaoFa6RA/JoeDiGenovia">Joe diGenovia</a> are a husband-and-wife team,&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://HUpeQphJh0qq5iQpbKhSBQ/DiGenovaToensing">diGenova &amp; Toensing</a>, considered for part of Trump's legal team. Due to conflicts of interest, however, they did not join. Among other things,&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://pAN8rjhK1UyYQbxu--dQig/VictoriaToensing">Victoria Toensing</a> represented <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Vn2Yu8OfSEKef7fzzSLTAQ/ScooterLibby">Scooter Libby</a> at the time of his pardon by Trump.</p>
<p>What earns them a spot on this list, is once more, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://auLZC9Le7E-ToRSqqhvZwQ/SeanHannity">Sean Hannity</a>. It appears to be a minor matter of a cease-and-desist letter, but it's Hannity again, and the number of overlapping lawyers to the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Is Hannity suggesting lawyers he knows to Trump? That would suggest a highly improper connection between the presidency and journalism.</p>
<p>But it certainly demonstrates a high degree of connectedness.</p>
<h2><a class="thought-link" href="brain://VULq0gHP20yzrkVUh-UfTg/RudyGiuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a></h2>
<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://VULq0gHP20yzrkVUh-UfTg/RudyGiuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://JonppG0lfkaulR-3H8p0dA/PreetBharara">Preet Bharara</a>, and&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://DKmqjOIv0U-wnh5H7ER2gA/GeoffreyBerman">Geoffrey Berman</a></p>
<p>These three are current and past holders of the office of&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://d7_hX3uMLkOiLO_ZVtcw1A/UsAttorneySouthernNy">US Attorney Southern NY</a>. Preet is not a member of this list, but is part of the story.</p>
