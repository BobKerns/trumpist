He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.</p>
<div id="newsletter-promo" class="newsletter-signup auto-newsletter" data-newsletter-productcode="" data-newsletter-producttitle="">&ldquo;We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,&rdquo; he wrote in response to a question from The Times. &ldquo;Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.&rdquo;</div>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="99" data-total-count="3733">&ldquo;I remember being super confused,&rdquo; said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="195" data-total-count="3928">&ldquo;I kept asking Alexander, &lsquo;Can you explain to me what they want?&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, referring to Mr. Nix. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="4172">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sending them stuff about political targeting &mdash; they then come and ask more about political targeting,&rdquo; Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil &ldquo;just didn&rsquo;t seem to be interested&rdquo; in how the techniques could be used commercially.</p>
