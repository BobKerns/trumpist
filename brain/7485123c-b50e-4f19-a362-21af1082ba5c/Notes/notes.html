<h1><strong>Trumpists</strong></h1>
<p>This work began on March 4, as I was trying to make sense of the news of the day and realizing the names and connections were multiplying faster than I could grasp them.</p>
<p>Between the&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://api.thebrain.com/HAfVKU8pk0KW9ZMzX54pTw/aF29Cr2V7EylRiq2qf8gZA/NastyaRybka">Nastya Rybka</a> story and the Mueller looking at&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://api.thebrain.com/HAfVKU8pk0KW9ZMzX54pTw/ojQ1i9I1x0ezKhXZw1ZhQw/GeorgeNader">George Nader</a> and his connections, I decided I needed to play catch-up, and build a model to understand how all these people, organizations, and events fit together.</p>
<p>The result is a complex web of relationships. But don't be put off by the visual clutter. I've put a fair bit of work into making it easy to navigate. In another document I'll go into more detail, but remember, the search box is your friend.</p>

<h2>Important Caveats&nbsp;</h2>
<p>It is important to understand what this is, and is not. It is intentionally very inclusive, yet incomplete. The intended use is to enable me, personally, to identify and track reported connections.</p>
<p>It is&nbsp;<em>not</em> to make a case of guilt for anyone. On the surface, this resembles the sort of "connections everywhere" on which conspiracy theories build, but the intent here is very different.</p>
<p>The evidence linked is of varying quality. Some of the connections here will be trivial. Some of the people tagged as "implicated" are only implicated in the sense that they are part of an organization which is implicated in some form of wrong-doing&mdash;possibly only providing PR spin for others. Some allegations will be false.</p>
<p>The links, tags, and other metadata should be regarded as indicating things that the investigators&nbsp;<em>could be</em> looking at. This is an aid to exploration; base any conclusions on the available evidence.</p>
<p>Where possible, I link to supporting documentation. The quality varies from primary source materials and court filings, to news articles from sources of varying quality, to official bios, to Wikipedia pages, to twitter posts. Linking does not imply endorsement!</p>
<p>The links and documents are not curated. I supply them for quick context, and have chosen them on the basis of convenience, not quality.</p>
<p>That said, I&nbsp;<em>am</em> working to improve the scope and quality of the links. I have quite a lot more material captured, and I welcome suggestions.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is perpetually in chaos, so it is very difficult to track the personnel changes. Beware of out-of-date information, and let me know so I can update!</p>
<h2>About TheBrain</h2>
<p>I built this using a mind-mapping product I have used for the past 20 years, called TheBrain. It is not perfect for the task, and I have warped my mental model a bit to fit within the constraints and strengths of the tool.</p>
<p>It is, at its heart, a mesh of nodes and arrows. This is a simple and powerful metaphor for modelling, but simplicity in metaphor sometimes forces complexity into the model. I'll explain some of the issues in another document when I discuss some of the more detailed model.</p>
