<pre>Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. (the 'Committee') is filing this miscellaneous report consistent with 11 CFR 102.13 and 100.3(a)(3) to disavow a number of committees that have sprung up that appear to be using Donald J. Trump's name, image, likeness, or slogans in connection with soliciting contributions and conducting other activities. 

This Committee is concerned about the likelihood of confusion among the public, which may be led to believe such activities are authorized by Mr. Trump or this Committee or that contributions to such unauthorized committees are being made to Mr. Trump's campaign, when they are not. As such, the Committee wishes to place this disavowal notice on the public record that the following committees are not authorized by Mr. Trump:

Given the groundswell of grassroots support for Mr. Trump's candidacy, we understand the registration of similar unauthorized committees may continue. While we certainly respect these committees' First Amendment rights, given that we have over 75,000 donors, we must ensure our supporters are protected and there is no confusion about the unauthorized nature of such efforts (from which we have received no money, goods or services), especially when they use Mr. Trump's name, slogan, or likeness in their name or solicitation materials. As such, the Committee may file additional miscellaneous reports about additional unauthorized committees that may be created or discovered in the future.</pre>
