<p>&ldquo;Todd had a strong impact on New Mexico politics, and his hard work in support of our candidates and building the party will not be forgotten,&rdquo; said former Republican Party of New Mexico Chairman Debbie Maestas. &ldquo;He advocated tirelessly for the Trump campaign last year in New Mexico, and was instrumental in RPNM's success during my chairmanship. Secretary Mattis and the Pentagon are lucky to have him, and I wish him the best of luck in his new position.&rdquo;</p>
