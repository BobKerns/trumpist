<p><strong>Dec. 1 </strong>&mdash; <a class="thought-link" href="brain://FPnI7WWl3kyNJMDM4Gu8Gw/MichaelFlynn">Flynn</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://MsQ34_-Im0Cqo8cqngvu3g/JaredKushner">Jared Kushner</a>, Trump&rsquo;s son-in-law and adviser, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/politics/senate-jared-kushner-russia.html">meet</a> with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://yF22pYGyU0Wtr3PsBj1T4Q/SergeyKislyak">Kislyak</a>, the Russian ambassador, at Trump Tower. (The White House did not <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/jared-kushner-michael-flynn-russian-ambassador-meeting-235622">acknowledge</a> the meeting occurred until it was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/us/politics/senate-jared-kushner-russia.html?referer=">disclosed</a> in March 2017. In a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN1A90CF?il=0">statement</a> to congressional investigators on July 24, 2017, Kushner described the contents of the meeting. He said Kislyak &ldquo;wanted to convey information from what he called his &lsquo;generals&rsquo;&rdquo; about &ldquo;U.S. policy in Syria.&rdquo; Kushner said the exchange of information did not occur at that time because neither party could arrange a secure line of communication. &ldquo;I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration,&rdquo; Kushner&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/24/politics/jared-kushner-statement-russia-2016-election/index.html">statement</a> reads.)</p>
