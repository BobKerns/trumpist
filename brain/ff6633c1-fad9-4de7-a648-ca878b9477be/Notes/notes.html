Ms. Butina, who appears to have been active with the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://QKf8WVOW3F2RT6ZbfqxGCg/Nra">NRA</a> in recent years within the U.S. reportedly has founded a Russian counterpart gun advocacy organization. She may be able to clarify for the Committee the origin and purpose of alleged Russian-directed efforts to approach U.S. organizations and persons connected to the Trump campaign throughout and prior to 2016. The Minority believes that it is important to request as a matter of record Ms. Butina&rsquo;s cooperation even if she is not a U.S. citizen; however, she may be living in the United States.</p>
