<p>In his <a class="thought-link" href="brain://5dCfje79AFywTN5W9kxB4w/20171130">2017-11-30</a> interview, Attorney General Sessions refused to answer questions from the Committee that pertained to his conversations with President Trump about Russia&rsquo;s interference and the Federal Bureau of Investigation [<a class="thought-link" href="brain://mkDldvRZK1WZJ1bTUwnXUA/Fbi">FBI</a>] and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://2brBW9ti6VyKXHMa61nQ2A/SpecialCounsel">Special Counsel</a>&rsquo;s Russia investigations, including whether President Trump ever instructed AG Sessions to take any action to frustrate or obstruct the Russia investigation under the Department of Justice&rsquo;s [<a class="thought-link" href="brain://rghLMUxiBF6c5rqa-GOcVg/Doj">DOJ</a>] purview. It is in the Committee and Congress&rsquo; strong interest to compel AG Sessions&rsquo;s testimony on this matter to clarify whether and to what extent President Trump or his associates have sought to place undue pressure on the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://rghLMUxiBF6c5rqa-GOcVg/Doj">DOJ</a> or <a class="thought-link" href="brain://mkDldvRZK1WZJ1bTUwnXUA/Fbi">FBI</a> for political ends.</p>
