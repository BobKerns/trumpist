<p>Alan Dershowitz ends up in this in three different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><a class="thought-link" href="brain://Jl5UuutryUOExsO-98MsgQ/DershowitzDinnerWTrump">Dershowitz Dinner w/ Trump</a></li>
<li>References in <a class="thought-link" href="brain://7EerB9sVPUy7xHbjkusdKA/BroidyVQatar">Broidy v Qatar</a></li>
<li>His entanglement in the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://rSMIW-Zu70uU7oCUnhQYHA/JeffreyEpstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> cases.</li>
</ol>
<p>#3 deserves some special mention. He was brought into it in the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://rFkLd6YgCUyvwTN58QsLxg/DoeCvraPetition">Doe CVRA Petition</a> case, via allegations via Jane Doe #3.</p>
<p>In response, he joins the case as an intervenor, and offers refutations which should be verifiable to investigators, and references other allegations made by the same Jane Doe #3 which were not supported.</p>
<p>I believe these allegations against Dershowitz were ultimately withdrawn as defamatory. He rightly pointed out that they served no role in the CVRA case where he had been not involved in the original, except as advisor to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://rSMIW-Zu70uU7oCUnhQYHA/JeffreyEpstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>The timing, the forum, the history, and the fact that most of his refutations should be solidly verifiable, lead me to believe they are unlikely to be true.</p>
<p>I am concerned that Epstein may have been weaponized in some fashion. A form of blackmail without necessity of guilt. I don't mean this to offer a conspiracy theory, but rather a caution about embracing guilt by association.</p>
<p>[I really do <em>not</em> like Dershowitz, but for some of the same reasons I do not like him, I defend truth over a possible smear.]</p>
