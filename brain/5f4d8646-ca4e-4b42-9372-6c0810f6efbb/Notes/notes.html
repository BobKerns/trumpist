<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<h2>Information from this site:</h2>
<p>I do not operate the site on which this is hosted. It is hosted by TheBrain Technologies. I do not know what data they may collect, and I have no access to it.</p>
<p>I collect no personal information of any sort via this site. I do not have access to IP addresses, email addresses, social media or other identities or usernames, collected by TheBrain Technologies, Google, or any other third party (such as your ISP or government spies).</p>
<p>I may make use of tracking URLs, both to direct people to this site, and to track what external links are clicked. I use this to determine the level of interest, as aggregated numbers of clicks. This information may be tagged with where the link originated (e.g. a Facebook or Twitter post). I only do this to determine if a link is being used, and not for any nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>I do not track what nodes you visit within this site. I do not have the technical ability to do so. I can only track what links you use to enter, and what links you click to exit.</p>
<p>Knowing that certain information is used heavily will allow me to put more effort into areas that are useful.</p>
<p>I plan to share the aggregated data here, once I get it set up and start receiving it. Other than that, I won't share data with anyone, unless:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compelled to do so by legal process, credible threats, or legal fees.</li>
<li>I perceive a credible significant threat to others.</li>
<li>Someone seizes (legally or otherwise) my computers and circumvents my protections.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within my personal limitations, I protect the privacy of others.</p>
<p>PS: I do not think any third party data collection will pose a threat, but that assessment is up to you, based on what conspiracies you believe in.</p>
<h2>Patreon:</h2>
<p>I am setting up a Patreon account. I won't share your donor information.</p>
<h2>Email and other private communications:</h2>
<p>While I will make a best effort subject to the above loose constraints, don't send me stuff I can't reasonably protect. I am not set up to be WikiLeaks.</p>
<p>Send anything private (or not) to <a href="mailto:BobKerns@ProtonMail.com">BobKerns@ProtonMail.com</a></p>
<h2>Secret Legal Process Canary:</h2>
<p>As of <a class="thought-link" href="brain://_j4FEfe8aky-PqExTIfGsA/20180402">2018-04-02</a> 23:49, I have not received any legal demands for information which cannot be publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>I don't expect any, either! There's no drama here; I object to them on principle, hence this canary.</p>
<h2>No Drama!</h2>
<p>I don't expect any of the above to be relevant in the slightest. This is purely a personal project I'm donating to the world.</p>
<p>But as a former knowledge professional, I try to uphold standards for privacy and integrity.</p>
