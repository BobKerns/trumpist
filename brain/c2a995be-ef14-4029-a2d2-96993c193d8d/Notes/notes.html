<h1>Bob Kerns</h1>
<p>My interest in politics began around 1970, while still in high school. I wrote to Senator Harold Hughes, and got him to send me the Congressional Record. For the last couple of years of high school, I got daily mailings the debates, committee transcripts, things read into the record, and more. These were often over 1 cm thick, and took up many shelves of my bedroom.</p>
<p>I had to leave that paper all behind when I went off to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://CcyUz0cOOkWEfympylerNw/Mit">MIT</a> in 1972. Over the next several years, I alternated between being a student and in industry, then moving to MIT Sponsored Research Staff for four years, at the Lab for Computer Science (now part of CSAIL (Computer Science &amp; AI Lab).</p>
<p>While a student, I created the first online interactive leaning environment, TEACH LISP, teaching the Lisp programming language. (This was for my senior thesis, which I never wrote. I opted to move onto research staff instead).</p>
<p>From MIT, I moved to a spinoff, Symbolics, which became the first dot com company on March 15, 1985.</p>
<p>A common theme of my career has been dealing with complex knowledge relationships. Much of that has centered around AI, both applications and fundamental tools. I have worked and consulted in the US, Japan, and Canada, for startups and multinationals.</p>
<p>I hope you find this work useful!</p>
