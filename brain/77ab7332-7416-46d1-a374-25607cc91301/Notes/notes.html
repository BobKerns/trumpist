<p>According to public reports, Mr. Erickson emailed Trump campaign officials during the election claiming that Russia was &ldquo;seeking a dialogue with the U.S.&rdquo; and would use the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://MnOrdxZ00UajdCVgfMkTAQ/Nra">NRA</a> annual convention in 2016 to make &ldquo;first contact.&rdquo; Mr. Erickson may be able to provide insight into reported Russian-directed efforts throughout and possibly prior to 2016 to approach U.S. organizations and persons. He may also have insight into the actions of <a class="thought-link" href="brain://MzsT7JQKAkib-iCSfjeIAA/AlexanderTorshin">Alexander Torshin</a>, a deputy governor of the Central <a class="thought-link" href="brain://elyNYZkhJ0G8Kpv9VWKSxg/BankOfRussia">Bank of Russia</a>, and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://43Zsa5pWikewmhA5tC7ueg/MariaButina">Maria Butina</a>, reportedly a former assistant to Mr. Torshin, at the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://jyeyuazNxEOjcE0PmwE4fQ/NraConvention">NRA convention</a>.</p>

<p>Public reports indicate Ms. <a class="thought-link" href="brain://43Zsa5pWikewmhA5tC7ueg/MariaButina">Butina</a>, previously an assistant to <a class="thought-link" href="brain://MzsT7JQKAkib-iCSfjeIAA/AlexanderTorshin">Alexander Torshin</a>, sought to facilitate meetings with Trump campaign officials and between <a href="brain://api.thebrain.com/HAfVKU8pk0KW9ZMzX54pTw/jitxgG2UtUKaB9VSWiST_Q/VladimirPutin">President Putin</a> and candidate Trump during the election. Ms. Butina, who appears to have been active with the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://MnOrdxZ00UajdCVgfMkTAQ/Nra">NRA</a> in recent years within the U.S. reportedly has founded a Russian counterpart gun advocacy organization. She may be able to clarify for the Committee the origin and purpose of alleged Russian-directed efforts to approach U.S. organizations and persons connected to the Trump campaign throughout and prior to 2016. The Minority believes that it is important to request as a matter of record Ms. Butina&rsquo;s cooperation even if she is not a U.S. citizen; however, she may be living in the United States.</p>
