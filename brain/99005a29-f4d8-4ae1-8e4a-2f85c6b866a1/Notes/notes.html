<p>Goldstein was part of the team that secured a 2015 corruption conviction of Sheldon Silver, the former Democratic speaker of the New York State Assembly. (Silver&rsquo;s conviction was overturned by a federal appeals court in July 2017, which ruled that there was an issue with the judge&rsquo;s instructions to the jury.)</p>
<p>Goldstein also successfully prosecuted three men associated with a New York City municipal fraud and kickback scheme project called CityTime. The investigation examined more than 150 bank accounts, hundreds of thousands of documents and more than 100 witnesses, according to the Justice Department.</p>
