<p>In consideration of the Special Counsel&rsquo;s ongoing investigative equities, the Committee also has deferred interviewing <a class="thought-link" href="brain://FPnI7WWl3kyNJMDM4Gu8Gw/MichaelFlynn">Michael Flynn</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://DCPAczT4k0Wp6stnXIltsA/PaulManafort">Paul Manafort</a>, <a class="thought-link" href="brain://0xLrOzsYwUmgnFO-bkY5EA/RichardGates">Richard Gates</a>, and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://6ztXAJNFi0mXNyvKLIH6bQ/GeorgePapadopoulos">George Papadopoulos</a>, but these interviews will be essential to a complete understanding of the issues of collusion and obstruction of justice. To conduct a legitimate investigation, the Committee would need to interview these individuals, whether or not they have reached plea agreements or are the subject of criminal indictments. For example, Mr. Flynn specifically informed the Committee via his attorney on June 7, 2017 that he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; the Committee did not demand his appearance, as a result. In light of Mr. Flynn&rsquo;s guilty plea, the Committee should revisit his appearance and seek to negotiate his testimony. The Committee also ought to interview other individuals who may be of investigative interest to the Special Counsel, reportedly such as <a class="thought-link" href="brain://ojQ1i9I1x0ezKhXZw1ZhQw/GeorgeNader">George Nader</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://FM1d_hM-m0Cx9Bx_3kDJ9A/SimonaMangiante">Simona Mangiante</a>.</p>
