<p>Now, the filings only show when the firm was paid, not when it provided its services. However, well before the current controversy, former <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> staffer <a class="thought-link" href="brain://vqgc8T3P0ki6C1Rv7RPWmw/MattOczkowski">Matt Oczkowski</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://8rST0-Fk70KLhD3D_pAAFg/BradParscale">Brad Parscale</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-did-cambridge-analytica-really-do-for-trumps-campaign/">described for <em>Wired </em>magazine</a> the work the firm did in the final months of the campaign.</p>
<p>Oczkowski told <em>Wired</em>, "The <a class="thought-link" href="brain://m80EF3vkZkOXVEKCZRpzFg/Rnc">RNC</a> was the voter file of record for the campaign, but we were the intelligence on top of the voter file."</p>
<p>"<a class="thought-link" href="brain://vqgc8T3P0ki6C1Rv7RPWmw/MattOczkowski">Matt Oczkowski</a> and his team created a daily tracker of polling, so that I could see how Trump was doing in key swing states," Parscale said. "They provided that to me daily."</p>
<p>Plus, Parscale said <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a> helped with "persuasion online media buying," and "they created a visualization tool that showed in each state which areas were most persuadable and what those voters care about."</p>
<p>It bears noting that while the Trump campaign didn&rsquo;t rely on <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>&rsquo;s voter data for core voter outreach, the firm stayed busy attacking Trump&rsquo;s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>In the final months of the election, the firm was paid about $850,000 by the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://TEw9o2VPBUOMT84waheWnA/MakeAmericaNumber1">Make America Number 1</a> Super PAC. The group&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2016/11/make-america-number-1/">self-declared aim</a> was "to make clear to the American voter the full extent of the untrustworthiness of <a class="thought-link" href="brain://8_wR0Uqxv0GN_fQlfGtDhw/HillaryClinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> (HRC) by focusing on the corruption of the Clinton Machine and especially the corruption of the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://aAi3c0Ea8Um5ugs8Jv0TPA/ClintonFoundation">Clinton Foundation</a>."</p>
<p><a class="thought-link" href="brain://D_JOLtsqBEyOC-TONUCV9w/RobertMercer">Robert Mercer</a>, a conservative billionaire, was the PAC&rsquo;s primary financial backer.</p>
<p>So, while Cambridge Analytica played a lesser role in its direct work for the Trump campaign, it actively aided Trump&rsquo;s candidacy in other ways.</p>
