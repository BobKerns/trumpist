<p>In a&nbsp;<a class="thought-link" href="brain://gpihazx6K0i4zUhYatywOg/20171216">2017-12-16</a> letter to the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://qpNqOn6PvUaZ0IyV32Xenw/HouseCommitteeOnOversightAndGovernmentReform">House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform</a> and the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://aOZYenyJnUuuqbjzmdfwtA/SenateCommitteeOnHomelandSecurityAndGovernmentalAffairs">Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs</a>, a law and crisis management firm writing on behalf of Trump for America, Inc, (<a class="thought-link" href="brain://BWr8SD_JnEmddOAvfuxNTg/Tfa">TFA</a>) (the entity formed for the purpose of President Trump&rsquo;s transition) asserted that the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://lvB4bss2NE2EkonVMpwUOQ/Gsa">GSA</a> &ldquo;unlawfully produced TFA&rsquo;s private materials, including privileged communications, to the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://B0XTa4eDVkW090fzr-mnYw/SpecialCounselsOffice">Special Counsel&rsquo;s Office</a>,&rdquo; which, in turn, reportedly has used these records extensively in interviews, &ldquo;including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege.&rdquo; The <a class="thought-link" href="brain://B0XTa4eDVkW090fzr-mnYw/SpecialCounsel">Special Counsel</a>&rsquo;s Office disputed the accusation, noting: &ldquo;When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner&rsquo;s consent or appropriate criminal process.&rdquo; <a class="thought-link" href="brain://lvB4bss2NE2EkonVMpwUOQ/Gsa">GSA</a> also responded to press inquiries to clarify that <a class="thought-link" href="brain://lvB4bss2NE2EkonVMpwUOQ/Gsa">GSA</a> informed transition team members that, by using devices provided by <a class="thought-link" href="brain://lvB4bss2NE2EkonVMpwUOQ/Gsa">GSA</a>, materials &ldquo;would not be held back in any law enforcement&rdquo; requests. The TFA allegation against the Special Council and GSA raises deep concern that <a class="thought-link" href="brain://BWr8SD_JnEmddOAvfuxNTg/Tfa">TFA</a> may have in fact withheld from the Committee, potentially on unspecified privilege claims not recognized by Congress, responsive material that is relevant to the Committee&rsquo;s investigation. The Minority therefore believes it is essential that the Committee request directly from <a class="thought-link" href="brain://lvB4bss2NE2EkonVMpwUOQ/Gsa">GSA</a> all transition-related holdings that were already shared with the <a class="thought-link" href="brain://B0XTa4eDVkW090fzr-mnYw/SpecialCounsel">Special Counsel</a>&rsquo;s Office to ensure that the Committee has access to the full scope of relevant material and can determine independently whether <a class="thought-link" href="brain://BWr8SD_JnEmddOAvfuxNTg/Tfa">TFA</a> improperly withheld material from the Committee pertinent to our investigation.</p>
