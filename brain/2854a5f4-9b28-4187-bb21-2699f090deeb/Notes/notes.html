<p>James Quarles was a young assistant special prosecutor on the Watergate Special Prosecution Force in the mid-1970s. He then joined the Boston-based law firm Hale and Dorr and led its Washington office while specializing in intellectual property litigation. That law firm merged with an old-line DC partnership &mdash; Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering &mdash; and Quarles joined its executive committee. Mueller also worked at that firm, known as <a class="thought-link" href="brain://tKFDq8YkYkqrEymLeAcmMA/WilmerHale">WilmerHale</a>, and he brought Quarles along after he was appointed special counsel.</p>
