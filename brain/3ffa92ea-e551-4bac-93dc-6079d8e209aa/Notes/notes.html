<p>The Committee ought to interview all relevant persons involved or associated with the Trump campaign&rsquo;s digital operation to determine whether the campaign coordinated in any way with Russia in its digital program. The Committee will not be able to fully evaluate the campaign&rsquo;s digital operation without speaking to a broader cross-section of individuals who can provide greater insight into the digital operation&rsquo;s day-to-day activities or its relationship with <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>. The Committee also must interview individuals from other companies who conducted technology-related work on behalf of the Trump campaign or on behalf of other entities being funded through independent expenditures to gain a full picture of whether there was any coordination between Russia&rsquo;s extensive social media efforts on Trump&rsquo;s behalf and the campaign itself.</p>
<p>For example, Avraham (Avi) (<a class="thought-link" href="brain://swvItxxZpEqbPHhu11CQaA/AviBerkowitz">Avi) Berkowitz</a>, served as Assistant Director of Data Analytics on the Trump Campaign. He was also an associate of <a class="thought-link" href="brain://MsQ34_-Im0Cqo8cqngvu3g/JaredKushner">Jared Kushner</a> and <a class="thought-link" href="brain://8rST0-Fk70KLhD3D_pAAFg/BradParscale">Brad Parscale</a>. The Committee has reason to believe that Mr. Kushner may have dispatched Mr. Berkowitz to meet with Russian Ambassador <a class="thought-link" href="brain://yF22pYGyU0Wtr3PsBj1T4Q/SergeyKislyak">Sergey Kislyak</a> in <a class="thought-link" href="brain://oLLC0jEatEaVhR9oOQ120w/201612">December 2016</a>. <a class="thought-link" href="brain://nHUExtlqR0SyCaN7O_qvaw/TheresaHong">Theresa Hong</a>, who served as Digital Content Director for the Trump campaign, should also be asked to testify. Ms. Hong has spoken to the press about the campaign&rsquo;s digital operation and her team&rsquo;s work alongside <a class="thought-link" href="brain://Yj7JqdeCNk6zr6mpKeokPQ/CambridgeAnalytica">Cambridge Analytica</a>.</p>
