<p>(New York, NY) &ndash; President-elect Donald J. Trump met yesterday with U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions in his office in New York.</p>
<p>While nothing has been finalized and he is still talking with others as he forms his cabinet, the President-elect has been unbelievably impressed with Senator Sessions and his phenomenal record as Alabama's Attorney General and U.S. Attorney. It is no wonder the people of Alabama re-elected him without opposition.</p>
