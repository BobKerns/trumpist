<p><strong>Dec. 22</strong> &mdash; Flynn calls Kislyak and asks if Russia would delay or defeat <a href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2334(2016)">an upcoming U.N. Security Council resolution</a> vote that sought to condemn Israel&rsquo;s building of settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The Obama administration <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/23/politics/israel-official-rips-obama-un-settlements/index.html">agreed</a> to allow the resolution to come up for a vote &mdash; angering Israeli Prime Minister <a class="thought-link" href="brain://3-gKRgeMx0qcY9CmH_CT8w/BenjaminNetanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. (A day later, the U.N. resolution <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2016/sc12657.doc.htm">would pass</a>, with Russia voting in favor and the U.S. abstaining from voting.)</p>
