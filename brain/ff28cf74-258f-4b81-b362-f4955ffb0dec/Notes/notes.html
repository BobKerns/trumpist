<h1>REPUBLICAN CONTRACT WITH AMERICA</h1>
<p><em><strong>As Republican Members of the House of Representatives and as citizens seeking to join that body we propose not just to change its policies, but even more important, to restore the bonds of trust between the people and their elected representatives.</strong></em></p>
<p>That is why, in this era of official evasion and posturing, we offer instead a detailed agenda for national renewal, a written commitment with no fine print.</p>
<p>This year's election offers the chance, after four decades of one-party control, to bring to the House a new majority that will transform the way Congress works. That historic change would be the end of government that is too big, too intrusive, and too easy with the public's money. It can be the beginning of a Congress that respects the values and shares the faith of the American family.</p>
<p>Like Lincoln, our first Republican president, we intend to act "with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right." To restore accountability to Congress. To end its cycle of scandal and disgrace. To make us all proud again of the way free people govern themselves.</p>
<p>On the first day of the 104th Congress, the new Republican majority will immediately pass the following major reforms, aimed at restoring the faith and trust of the American people in their government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIRST, </strong>require all laws that apply to the rest of the country also apply equally to the Congress;</li>
<li><strong>SECOND, </strong>select a major, independent auditing firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Congress for waste, fraud or abuse;</li>
<li><strong>THIRD, </strong>cut the number of House committees, and cut committee staff by one-third;</li>
<li><strong>FOURTH, </strong>limit the terms of all committee chairs;</li>
<li><strong>FIFTH, </strong>ban the casting of proxy votes in committee;</li>
<li><strong>SIXTH, </strong>require committee meetings to be open to the public;</li>
<li><strong>SEVENTH, </strong>require a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase;</li>
<li><strong>EIGHTH, </strong>guarantee an honest accounting of our Federal Budget by implementing zero base-line budgeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thereafter, within the first 100 days of the 104th Congress, we shall bring to the House Floor the following bills, each to be given full and open debate, each to be given a clear and fair vote and each to be immediately available this day for public inspection and scrutiny.</p>
